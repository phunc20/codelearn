/*
Data types, whose names have the form arr_##name or matrix_##name, are already defined with the following structures:
typedef struct arr_##name{
    type* arr;
    int size;
} arr_##name;

typedef struct matrix_##name {
    arr_##name* arr;
    int size;
} matrix_##name;
If the task's output type is one of above types, your output will be scored according to the attributes[size and arr] of the returned object.
You can read the FAQ to gain a better understanding.
