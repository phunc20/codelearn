A positive integer is called a **t-prime** if it has only three divisors, e.g.
- `4` is a t-prime because its divisors are `1,2,4`, there are three of them.
- `6` is a not t-prime because its divisors are `1,2,3,6`, there are four of them.


Positive integers can be decomposed into product of primes, so we can see that
> all t-primes are squares of prime numbers, i.e. $n$ is a t-prime iff $n = p^2$ where $p$ is a prime.
