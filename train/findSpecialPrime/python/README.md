## Ideas
01. Intuitive and naive: test each odd integer with a function `is_special()` -- This is what `a.py` to `f.py` do.
  - Seems to be too slow to pass the hidden tests.
02. Find successively special primes of
  - one digit: `2,3,5,7`
  - two digits: `23, 29, 31, ...`
  - three digits
  - etc.
